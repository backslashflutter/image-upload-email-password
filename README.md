# image_upload_firebase_flutter
Image Upload and Retireve Using Firebase And Flutter alongside, CloudFirestore and Firebase Storage. 


# Overview
This git is a successor of our inital git for creating the email and password authentication. Now, in this git we have created a imageupload and retireval system so that the particular user can upload the image from their gallery and alaso after uploading that image can show that in the streambuilder screen. 
I have focussed more on managing our database from developer's end so that our user don't face any issue.
