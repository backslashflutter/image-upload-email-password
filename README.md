# image_upload_firebase_flutter
Image Upload and Retireve Using Firebase And Flutter alongside, CloudFirestore and Firebase Storage. 


# Overview
This git is a successor of our inital git for creating the email and password authentication. Now, in this git we have created a imageupload and retireval system so that the particular user can upload the image from their gallery and alaso after uploading that image can show that in the streambuilder screen. 
I have focussed more on managing our database from developer's end so that our user don't face any issue.

## Building the project

### Missing google-services.json file

If you try to build the project straight away, you'll get an error complaining that a `google-services.jsopn` file is missing  To resolve that,

1.  Open Your Firebase account and implement the firebase to your application. And if you face any issue in intergrating this then you can see the tutorial for this on our channel. 

Place the google-services.json in android/app folder
